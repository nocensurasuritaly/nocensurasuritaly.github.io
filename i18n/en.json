Many posts are removed just because they could generate <strong>negative</strong> comments.

Meanwhile, in the sign of protest, we invite all the users to <strong>leave</strong> that subreddit and to join more democratic communities, like <a>r/Italia</a>.",

  "vocxpa": "This group of Reddit users wants to expose the rampant censorship on r/italy. Our objective is to push the moderators of the biggest Italian community on Reddit to reconsider their actions. Too many times posts that we in line with the rules have been removed <strong>without a valid reason</strong> and in many cases asking for an explanation has led to  an <strong>unjustified permanent ban</strong>.",
